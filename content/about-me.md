## About Me

Hi, I'm **Suvash Kumar**, a student of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Rajshahi, and a former Junior Software Engineer at Tinkers Technologies Limited.

I'm passionate about software development and artificial intelligence, with a goal to become a skilled software engineer. I love Python and JavaScript, and I actively contribute to the open-source community.

In my free time, I enjoy coding, writing blogs, and exploring technology. I also write in Bengali to address the lack of Bangla content about tech on the internet.
