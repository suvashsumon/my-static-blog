Thanks for visiting this site. I am sure you know that this is a personal blog site of Suvash Kumar.

So, yes, my name is Suvash Kumar.

I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at University of Rajshahi. Earlier, I studied at Rajshahi Government City College. This is my acquaintance. Seriously, that's all.

## What is My Goal

From the first day of high school life I decided that I would become an electrical engineer. Since I am more interested in software than hardware, now I want to be a software engineer. So my goal right now is to become a skilled software engineer. Also, I am very interested in artificial intelligence. I would like to do research in this field if possible.

## About My Work

Most of the day I sit in front of a laptop or desktop. The rest of the time I spend in class, on campus, in tuition, in different alleys of Rajshahi city or sleeping in my room. Python and JavaScript are my favorite languages. I always try to contribute to the open source community. If you have time, you can visit my GitHub profile.

## The Purpose of This Blog

If you are a Bangladeshi, then you must know that there is a great lack of Bangla content on the internet regarding technology. Most people have to follow English content. Since I deal with many topics on the internet, I try to write in Bengali about some of them. Of course sometimes I also write in English.

## Contact Me

If you want to contact me, please mail me without any hesitation. Believe me I check mail every day. Facebook is not my favorite site. So I can't guarantee to reply if you message on Facebook. And if you know me, call me directly.
